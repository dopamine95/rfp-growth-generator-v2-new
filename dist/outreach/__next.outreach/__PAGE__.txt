8:T403,Dear [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out from Three Trees Center for Change, where we've developed an evidence-based approach to student conduct and development that might align with University of California's goals.

Our programs use Cognitive Behavioral Inquiry (CBI) to help students examine choices, understand patterns, and develop skills for better decision-making. We're already partnering with USC, UNC Charlotte, Winthrop, and University of Portland with a 93.4% measured success rate.

Our university package includes:
- Alcohol and Other Drug education
- Academic Resilience support  
- Responsible Relationships training
- Unlimited student referrals
- Comprehensive progress tracking

The model: $250k-500k annual contract (based on student body size), first month free to prove value.

Could we schedule 15 minutes for me to show you our AOD course demo? I think you'll see why our partner schools love working with us.

Best,
Amine Feliachi
Three Trees Center for Change
